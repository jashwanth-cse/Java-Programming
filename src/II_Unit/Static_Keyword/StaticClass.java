 * * We can't use static keywords with the top-level outer class, 
 * * but we can use static keywords with nested classes. 
 * * So, the nested class declared with a static keyword is 
 * * known as a static nested class.
 * *
 * * Some important points related to static nested class:
 * * - Inner is a static nested class.
 * * - It can be instantiated without an instance of Outer class.
 * * - Static nested classes can't access the outer class's non-static members;
 * *   they can only access the static member variable of the class.
 * *
 * * This Java snippet illustrates:
 * * - How the 'super' keyword accesses parent class constructor

 * Think of the static nested class as a guest speaker at a temple event.
 * He doesn’t need to be a devotee (object of outer class),
 * but he can still quote the temple’s scriptures (static members).
