/**
 * * This file is part of the Java Programming Lecture project.
 * * This file demonstrates method overriding, a form of dynamic polymorphism.
 * * Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation
 * * of a method that is already defined in its superclass (parent class).
 * * In this example, the `methodA` in the `DerivedClass` overrides the 
 * * `methodA` in the `BaseClass`.
 * * When the method is called on an object of the derived class, 
 * * the overridden method in
 * * the derived class is executed, demonstrating polymorphism.
 * * This is a common practice in Java to achieve runtime polymorphism.

Note: As you can see the methodA has 2 different forms in
